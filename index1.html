			lion Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. lion Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap.

			It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using lion Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
